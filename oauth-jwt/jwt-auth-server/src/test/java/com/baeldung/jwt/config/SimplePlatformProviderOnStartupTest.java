================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The onStartup function exposes a Runnable, which might be a potential security vulnerability if the users are allowed to provide arbitrary code to be executed as the startupHook.
Solution: Ensure that the code executed in the Runnable is secure and cannot be influenced by user input. If the Runnable can be influenced by user input, make sure that it is properly sanitized to protect against attacks such as code injection.

Vulnerability: Potential Insecure Third-Party Libraries
Issue: Third-party libraries might have unknown security vulnerabilities. It's always important to keep them updated to their latest versions.
Solution: Regularly update third-party libraries to latest secure versions, monitor community for security vulnerabilities in dependencies and update accordingly.

Vulnerability: File System Interaction
Issue: If the software reads or writes files to a location that is outside the intended control sphere, it could lead to system file modifications, disclosure of confidential information, or reading uninitialized data.
Solution: Ensure that file operations are limited to a restricted directory, such as directories with no special system files, and that file paths are not influenced by user-input to avoid directory traversal attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing for the successful execution of provided startupHook
Details:  
  TestName: runGivenStartupHookSuccessfully.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the provided startupHook is being run successfully.
  Execution:
    Arrange: The startupHook runnable is prepared.
    Act: Invoke the onStartup method with the startupHook runnable.
    Assert: Validate that the Runnable has been run.
  Validation: 
    The assertion validates that the Runnable was run as expected. This test is crucial to know the behavior of the system when the startupHook is run successfully.

Scenario 2: Testing the behaviour when a Null startupHook is provided
Details:  
  TestName: runStartupHookWithNullInput.
  Description: The test is supposed to check the behavior of the onStartup method is provided with a null Runnable. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: null is set as the startupHook. 
    Act: Invoke the onStartup method with null. 
    Assert: A NullPointerException is expected to be thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion will confirm that the method correctly throws NullPointerException when a null Runnable is supplied. This test is important to see if the method can properly handle null inputs.

Scenario 3: Testing for the execution of startupHook containing exception
Details:  
  TestName: runStartupHookWithException.
  Description: This test will focus on assessing the method's reaction to a Runnable that throws an exception. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare the startupHook runnable to throw an exception when run. 
    Act: Invoke the onStartup method with the prepared Runnable. 
    Assert: Expect the exception to be thrown as per the Runnable's programming. 
  Validation: 
    The assertion in this scenario is to check if the method correctly propagates exceptions thrown by the Runnable. This is a significant test as it examines the error handling capacity of the onStartup method. 

Scenario 4: Testing for processing of multiple onStartup calls
Details:  
  TestName: runMultipleOnStartupCalls.
  Description: This test is meant to check if onStartup can successfully execute multiple startupHooks iteratively. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Prepare the multiple startupHooks. 
    Act: Invoke onStartup method multiple times with different Runnables. 
    Assert: Ensure that each Runnable has been run. 
  Validation: 
    The objective of the assertion is to verify that the onStartup method can correctly process multiple Runnables one after the other. This test is important to confirm the method's capacity for repetitive action.
