================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (Resource Exhaustion)
Issue: The code creates a new fixed thread pool with fixed 5 threads. This can pose risks if many long-running tasks are submitted and all threads are in use, then additional tasks will wait in the queue, leading to unbounded memory use.
Solution: The 'Executors.newFixedThreadPool()' should be replaced with a ThreadPoolExecutor in a 'try/catch' block. This way, you can properly handle rejected execution scenarios.

Vulnerability: CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
Issue: The code does not handle exceptions for potential issues raised during the creation of ThreadPool or Task submission. Unhandled exceptions could cause the system to stop unexpectedly, leading to DoS attacks.
Solution: Wrap thread pool execution areas in try-catch block to ensure exceptions are properly caught and handled.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Use of GET methods could lead to information disclosure in the URL where sensitive data might be logged or cached by intermediary systems.
Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive data in URL parameters. Always use POST/PUT methods to send sensitive data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing the creation of Fixed Thread Pool

Details:
  TestName: testFixedThreadPoolCreation
  Description: This test will check if a fixed thread pool of five threads is being returned when fixedThreadPool() method is invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed, as no specific parameters are given to the method.
  Act: Invoke the fixedThreadPool() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if returned object is an instance of ExecutorService and if the thread pool is fixed with 5 threads.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify the method successfully creates a fixed thread pool with the given number of threads. This is important as it provides a predictable and controlled method for handling concurrent tasks.

Scenario 2: Testing Thread Execution Behavior in Fixed Thread Pool

Details:
  TestName: testThreadExecutionBehavior
  Description: This test ensures that executing more than 5 tasks will queue the extras until a thread becomes available.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create more than 5 runnable tasks.
  Act: Invoke the fixedThreadPool() method and submit the tasks to it.
  Assert: Verify that only 5 tasks are running simultaneously.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the fixed thread pool size remains within the specified limit and queues extra tasks. This test scenario is significant as it demonstrates the bounded nature of a fixed thread pool which is its defining feature.

Scenario 3: Thread Interruption Handling

Details:
  TestName: testThreadInterruptionHandling
  Description: This test verifies that if a thread in the pool is interrupted, it doesn't affect the other threads and the pool size remains consistent.
Execution:
  Arrange: Submit several tasks to the thread pool and programmatically interrupt one of them during execution.
  Act: Invoke the fixedThreadPool() method and monitor the status of threads.
  Assert: Assert that the interruption of one thread doesn't affect the others and pool size remains constant.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that an interrupted thread does not reduce the thread pool size and does not impact the other threads. This test is important in a multithreading environment where robust handling of thread interruptions is necessary.

Scenario 4: Rejection Handling in Over Capacity Scenario

Details:
  TestName: testRejectionHandlingInOverCapacity
  Description: To test whether the thread pool created by fixedThreadPool() method handles over-capacity scenario correctly. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up tasks to be executed and invoke fixedThreadPool() and perform an action that runs more jobs than the thread pool can handle when it reaches its maximum size.
  Act: Attempt to execute more than 5 tasks simultaneously.
  Assert: Check if any RejectedExecutionException is thrown due to over-capacity.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that when the thread pool is saturated and cannot accept more tasks, it declines further requests, thus ensuring the stability of the system.
