================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: In the catch block, the exception is being caught and a new RuntimeException is being thrown. However, the details of the original exception (which may contain sensitive information) are not being logged.
Solution: Implement a proper logging mechanism which ensures security of sensitive data. Be sure to log the original exception for debugging purposes, but make sure not to log potentially sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-201: Information Exposure Through Sent Data
Issue: The servletRequest is being passed to the filterChain's doFilter method where it may be exposed to other filters or the endpoint itself. If the servletRequest contains sensitive data, it could potentially be exposed.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is not being included in the servletRequest, or ensure that all downstream handlers of the servletRequest are secure and trusted. If necessary, sanitize or encrypt sensitive data before including it in requests.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: In the catch block, a new RuntimeException is thrown without any specific message. This may lead to exceptions that do not provide enough information for debugging, or conversely, they may provide too much information, potentially exposing sensitive details.
Solution: Include a custom message when throwing exceptions that provides enough detail for debugging but does not expose potentially sensitive data. Use separate logs for debugging and user-facing messages, and restrict access to these logs.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: There's no validation of the servletRequest before it's used. If the servletRequest is manipulated, it could lead to undesired effects.
Solution: Perform input validation on the servletRequest before using it. Check for null values and instances of unexpected data types, and sanitize or reject any identified threats.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Filter Invocation
Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulFilterInvocation
  Description: This test will ascertain that the 'doFilter' method works as expected when everything is normal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for ServletRequest, ServletResponse, and FilterChain.
  Act: Invoke the 'doFilter' method with the previously created parameters.
  Assert: Confirm that the 'doFilter' method of FilterChain has been invoked and no exceptions were raised.
Validation:
  This test aims to validate that the 'doFilter' method behaves normally when no exception has been thrown. This is the basic usage scenario of this method and verifies that in a normal operation no exception will be thrown.

Scenario 2: FilterChain Throws Exception
Details:
  TestName: testWhenFilterChainThrowsException
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the 'doFilter' method when the 'doFilter' method of FilterChain throws an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for ServletRequest, ServletResponse, and FilterChain, and set up FilterChain to throw an exception when its 'doFilter' method is called.
  Act: Invoke the 'doFilter' method with the previously created parameters.
  Assert: Check that a RuntimeException has been thrown.
Validation:
  This scenario aims to verify that when 'doFilter' method of FilterChain throws an exception, our filter encapsulates it in a RuntimeException. This is important in the event of an error during filtering process, it should not be silently ignored.

Scenario 3: ServletRequest is not HttpServletRequest
Details:
  TestName: testWhenServletRequestIsNotHttpServletRequest
  Description: This test aims to verify the reaction of the 'doFilter' method when a ServletRequest that is not an instance of HttpServletRequest is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock for ServletRequest (not HttpServletRequest), ServletResponse, and FilterChain.
  Act: Invoke the 'doFilter' method with the created parameters.
  Assert: Assert that a ClassCastException has been thrown.
Validation:
  This test's assertion aims to verify that the 'doFilter' method can only manage ServletRequests that are instances of HttpServletRequest. This is to ensure the method operates within its specified parameter constraints.
