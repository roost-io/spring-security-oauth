================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-495: Unintended Security Weakness
Issue: The use of third-party libraries (like `ResteasyContext`, `Dispatcher`, `ResteasyProviderFactory`, `ResteasyProvider`) could potentially introduce unintended security weaknesses if they contain vulnerabilities and are not properly updated or configured.
Solution: Always use the latest, stable versions of third-party libraries, keep them updated, and follow their specific secure configuration practices. Validate and sanitize all input and output data if applicable.

Vulnerability: CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges
Issue: The method `pushContext` is public, which means it can be accessed from outside the class or package. If this method is dealing with sensitive data or operations, it could potentially be exploited.
Solution: Restrict method access levels as far as possible. If a method does need to be public, ensure sufficient runtime access controls and data sanitization routines are in place. In this case, consider changing the `pushContext` method to private if it does not need to be accessed from outside the class.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The method `pushContext` may be performing a critical function (since it's pushing a context to `ResteasyContext`). If the function is supposed to be acessible only to authenticated users or specific roles, it might be at risk of unauthorized access.
Solution: Ensure appropriate authentication and authorization controls are in place before exposing such methods. This can be achieved through the implementation of Java Security frameworks or App server specific security configurations.

""" 
  Scenario 1: Basic Valid Context Push Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testPushContextWithValidInput
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method pushContext properly works with valid class type and object instance as inputs. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid class type and its corresponding instance. 
    Act: Invoke the pushContext method with the class type and instance. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify no exceptions were thrown and mock Resteasy context got the pushed context.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify successful context push operation. If the context is appropriately pushed, it confirms that the given method functions correctly with valid inputs. 

  Scenario 2: Pushing Null Class Type Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testPushContextWithNullClassType
    Description: This test checks if the method pushContext handles null class type as input appropriately. It should throw an exception.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass null as the class type and a valid object instance.
    Act: Invoke the pushContext method with null class type and a valid object instance. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if an appropriate exception is thrown upon executing the method.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when null is passed as the class type. This condition is necessary to handle to prevent mishandling of context in the application.

  Scenario 3: Pushing Null Instance

  Details:  
    TestName: testPushContextWithNullInstance
    Description: This test checks if the method pushContext handles null instances being pushed to the context. It should throw an exception.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a valid class type and null as the instance.
    Act: Invoke the pushContext method with valid class type and null instance. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if an appropriate exception is thrown upon executing the method.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when null is passed as the instance. This condition is necessary to handle to prevent mishandling of context in the application.

  Scenario 4: Pushing Invalid Type Instance

  Details:  
    TestName: testPushContextWithInvalidTypeInstance
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method pushContext handles push of an instance that doesn't match the class type. It should throw an exception.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass Class A as class type and instance of Class B.
    Act: Invoke pushContext method with Class A and instance of Class B. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if an appropriate exception is thrown upon executing the method.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when an instance not matching with the class type is being pushed to context. This condition is necessary to handle to ensure the integrity of input data.
