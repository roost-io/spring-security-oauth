================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Hard-Coded Password CWE-259
Issue: The method getPassword() suggests it's returning a stored password. If the password is hard-coded or improperly stored, it might be easily compromised.
Solution: Avoid hard-coding password and instead use secure methods for saving password, such as password hashing and salting techniques.

Vulnerability: Plaintext Password Storage CWE-312
Issue: If the password is stored in plaintext in memory, it can be read by an attacker that has gained sufficient privileges.
Solution: Make sure passwords are not stored in plaintext. Use secure methods for saving password, like Java's SecretKeyFactory for creating a secret key from the provided password and storing that.

Vulnerability: Lack of Access Control CWE-284
Issue: The getPassword() method could be accessible by anyone depending on the class's visibility.
Solution: Implement proper access controls by using proper class/package visibility, and restrict who can access this sensitive information.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Getting Password Value

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetPasswordValue
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getPassword method returns the correct stored password. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a predefined password in the getPassword function. 
    Act: Invoke the getPassword method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned password matches the predefined password.
  Validation: 
    The assertion is verifying that the stored password is retrieved correctly when getPassword is called. This is expected because getPassword is supposed to return the password stored in it. This is crucial to ensure accurate retrieval of user passwords.

  Scenario 2: Test for Null Password Value

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetNullPasswordValue
    Description: This test is meant to check the behaviour of the getPassword function when no password is set (i.e., it is null). 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure the password is null in the getPassword function.
    Act: Invoke the getPassword method.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is null.
  Validation: 
    This test checks the condition where the password has not been set. It helps confirm that getPassword handles null password scenario without breaking, by returning a null value instead. This is critical to avoid potential Null Pointer Exceptions in the code calling this function.

  Scenario 3: Test for Empty Password String

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetEmptyPasswordValue
    Description: This test is meant to check the behaviour of the getPassword function when the password is set to an empty string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Make the password an empty string in the getPassword function.
    Act: Invoke the getPassword method.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    This test helps to affirm that getPassword can correctly handle scenarios where the password is an empty string. This scenario may arise if the user enters nothing in the password field. The function should simply return the empty string, not throw an exception or error, ensuring that the system handles edge cases smoothly.
