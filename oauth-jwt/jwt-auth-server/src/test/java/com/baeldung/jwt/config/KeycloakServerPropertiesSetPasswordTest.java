================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-259: Hard-Coded Password
Issue: The setPassword method can potentially allow for hard-coding passwords, which is a common security lapse where a password is embedded directly in the source code. This could lead to the exposure of resources if the source code is compromised.
Solution: Avoid hard-coding passwords in your code. Instead, use environment variables, secure password vaults, or external configuration files. Also consider using encrypted or hashed versions of passwords.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission
Issue: The password is likely to be transmitted in cleartext, which can be intercepted and read by unauthorized individuals. This increases the risk of unauthorized access.
Solution: Use secure communication protocols to transmit sensitive data such as HTTPS instead of HTTP. Alternatively, implement encryption or hashing techniques to protect the data during transmission.

  Scenario 1: Valid Password Entry Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetPasswordWithValidEntry.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPassword method works as expected when a valid password string is passed. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a predefined valid password string.
    Act: Invoke the setPassword method with the valid password string. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the initial null password with the set password.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to assert that the password is changed from null to the defined password string upon invoking the setPassword method. 
    The success of this test assures that the system can take a valid password string and set it as the password which is a fundamental part of a secure system.

  Scenario 2: Null Password Entry Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetPasswordWithNullEntry.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPassword method can handle null password entries without throwing exceptions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a predefined null password string.
    Act: Invoke the setPassword method with the null password string. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the initial null password with the null set password.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the password remains null when setPassword is called with a null value.
    This is important as it ensures that our system can handle null values gracefully without crashing.

  Scenario 3: Password Hashing Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testPasswordHash.
    Description: This test checks if the password is properly hashed before being set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a predefined password string.
    Act: Invoke the setPassword method and subsequently the getPassword method. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the entered password with the retrieved hashed password.
   Validation: 
    The assertion checks if the entered password gets hashed before being set. The significance of this test is to ensure the system correctly hashes passwords for secure storage.

  Scenario 4: Empty String Password Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetPasswordWithEmptyString.
    Description: This test checks if the setPassword method can handle an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a predefined empty string.
    Act: Invoke the setPassword method with an empty string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the initial null password with the set empty string.
   Validation: 
    The objective is to check that there are no exceptions when an empty string is passed as a parameter.
    Thus this test ensures that the system gracefully handles edge cases like entry of empty strings.
