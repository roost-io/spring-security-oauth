================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Context Data Leakage (Applicable if ResteasyContext contains sensitive data)
Issue: The clearContextData function could potentially result in information leakage if there is sensitive data in the ResteasyContext that is improperly managed or protected.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive information is appropriately encrypted before storing in the ResteasyContext. Always follow secure data handling practices, especially when handling user confidential data such as passwords and session information.

Vulnerability: Unsecured Randomness (CWE-330)
Issue: The application, although not explicit in the provided code, might use a predictable random number generator in security-sensitive context which could be exploited by an attacker to predict the outcome.
Solution: If your application uses RNG for any security context, it is advisable to use java.security.SecureRandom over java.util.Random. It provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG).

Vulnerability: Missing Exception handling
Issue: This snippet doesn't include Exception handling which may result in unexpected application behavior and potential data leaks or application crashes.
Solution: Ensure robust exception handling is implemented in your code. Avoid using generic exceptions and instead opt for specific ones. Also, never disclose sensitive information and system internals in error messages.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing whether the clearContextData() method works correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testClearContextDataMethod
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the clearContextData() method of the ResteasyContext class works as expected. This function is supposed to clear all context data, and upon successful operation, it should leave no data residue behind. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as we're not dealing with any parameters or data.
  Act: Invoke the clearContextData() method.
  Assert: Check if the ResteasyContext has no context data left after execution.
Validation: 
  Clarify that the ResteasyContext is completely cleaned after executing the clearContextData() method. This is significant as a successful operation indicates that the application's context management feature is functioning correctly, helping to avoid potentially undesired effects on other operations.

Scenario 2: Test behaviour of clearContextData() after multiple invocations

Details:  
  TestName: testMultipleClearContextDataInvocations
  Description: This test is to check the method's behavior after being called multiple times. The idea here is to ensure that the method is idempotent and does not cause any undesired side effects when invoked in succession.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as we're not dealing with any parameters or data.
  Act: Invoke the clearContextData() method multiple times.
  Assert: Check if the ResteasyContext has no context data left after execution and no exceptions or errors are thrown during the process.
Validation: 
  This verifies that the method is idempotent and does not have any unintended side effects or exceptions when invoked multiple times. This is fundamental in designing resilient programs.

Scenario 3: Test clearContextData() in multithreaded environment

Details:  
  TestName: testClearContextDataMultithreaded
  Description: This test is meant to verify that the method performs as expected when invoked from different threads. This simulation is important for applications that may be using this method in a multithreaded environment.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as we're not dealing with any parameters or data.
  Act: Invoke the clearContextData() method from multiple threads.
  Assert: Check if the ResteasyContext has no context data left after execution and no exceptions or errors are thrown during the process.
Validation: 
  This checks the method's thread safety. Its ability to function correctly in a multithreaded environment is crucial, especially for web-based applications where concurrent requests are common.
